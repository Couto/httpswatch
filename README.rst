HTTPSWatch
==========

This is the `HTTPSWatch project`_, a website that tracks the HTTPS support of
prominent websites.

The code is fairly simple. Python 3.4 is required. The ``check_https.py`` script
generates a small static site from JSON data in the ``config/`` directories and
Jinja2 templates from the ``templates/`` directory.

If you edit the HTML, please do not wrap HTML lines. (Paragraphs should be on
one line.)
