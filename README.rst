HTTPSWatch
==========

This is the HTTPSWatch project, a website that tracks the HTTPS support of
prominent websites.

The code is fairly simple. The ``check_https.py`` script generates an HTML page
using ``index.html.jinja``. Python 3.4 is required.

If you edit the HTML, please do not wrap HTML lines. (Paragraphs should be on
one line.)
